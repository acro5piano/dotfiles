  # you may set only one of name/class/role/title/type, or you may use more
  # than one together to restrict your matches.

  # the name, class, role, and title use simple wildcard matching such as those
  # used by a shell. you can use * to match any characters and ? to match
  # any single character.

  # the type is one of: normal, dialog, splash, utility, menu, toolbar, dock,
  #    or desktop

  # when multiple rules match a window, they will all be applied, in the
  # order that they appear in this list

    # change that attribute of the window

      # provided by the application, or chosen by openbox, instead.
